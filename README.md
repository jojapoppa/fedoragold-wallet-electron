### Notes

WalletShell relies on `service` to manage wallet container &amp; rpc communication.

Release installer & packaged archived includes a ready to use `service` binary, which is unmodified copy FED Coin release archive.

On first launch, WalletShell will try to detect location/path of bundled `service` binary, but if it's failed, you can manually set path to the `service` binary on the Settings screen.

If you don't trust the bundled `service` file, you can compare the checksum (sha256sum) against one from the official release, or simply download and use the binary from official FED Coin release, which is available here: https://github.com/jojapoppa/fedoragold-release. Then,  make sure to update your `service` path setting.
